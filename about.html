    <h2>Experience: Grass Valley internship, Summer 2018</h2>
    <p>
      I completed a 10 week internship for Grass Valley from July to September 2018, working in their Castle Donington office. I was part of a Core Technology team, working on some of the systems underlying their other products. I completed bug-fixing and polish on user interfaces in Angular 4, helping the company address some feedback from internal and external users. In the process I also gained experience with <a href="https://github.com/intuit/karate">Karate</a>, an API testing framework - I uncovered and helped troubleshoot a bug which, when fixed, ensured the build process for one of GV's core systems ran smoothly on all of its different deployment platforms.

    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p>
      My main hobby for the past few years has been writing and performing music. I've been heavily involved in the <a href="https://musicplayers.union.shef.ac.uk/">Music Players' Society</a> at university, being elected first as Rock Band Coordinator and then as President in my second and third year. It's taught me a lot about working with people in a more diverse team than my course, taking responsibility for fixing problems and organising events which benefit the society of 150+ members.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also a guitarist/vocalist and songwriter for the band Jumper Boy - A 4 Piece Indie Rock Band with Math Rock, Post Punk and Lo-Fi influences. We've released a 5-song EP on streaming services and played increasingly popular gigs in the Sheffield area.
